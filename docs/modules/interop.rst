Other population synthesis codes (``interop``)

The ``hydro`` module contains the functionality necessary for running simulations that use hydrodynamical
zoom-in simulations as their initial conditions. This includes the ability to read in snapshots,
centre and rotate them, estimate the galactic potential, get the initial conditions of star particles and
run a full ``cogsworth`` Population based on all that!
