Observables (``observables``)
*****************************

In ``observables`` you'll find functions for determining observables for the stars and binaries that are
produced in a ``cogsworth`` :class:`~cogsworth.pop.Population`. The main functionality is in 
:func:`~cogsworth.observables.get_extinction` and :func:`~cogsworth.observables.get_photometry`, 
but there are also some helper functions for dealing with magnitudes.
