This page tracks all of the changes that have been made to ``cogsworth``. We follow the standard versioning convention of A.B.C, where C is a patch/bugfix, B is a large bugfix or new feature and A is a major new breaking change. B/C are backwards compatible but A changes may be breaking.

2.0.2
=====
- Add some more flexbility to the ``plot_cartoon_binary`` function in terms of fontsize
- Allow use of pynbody 2.0 with cogsworth

2.0.1
=====

- Add clearer warning when pynbodyrc is not set up for FIRE (https://github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth/issues/137) 

2.0.0
=====

Major release to go with the release paper submission! ðŸŽ‰
- New feature: ``plot_cartoon_binary`` will now adjust the width of the binary based on the orbital separation and label simultaneous timesteps more clearly, also add a marker for disruption events
- Major change: calls like ``p.bpp`` will now raise an error if sampling is not yet done to avoid confusion
- Bug fix: Can now save and load unevolved populations
- Bug fix: Saving ``sampling_params`` now works correctly when you have a ``sampling_params`` object that includes a dictionary (nested dictionaries were causing crashes before)

1.2.0
=====

* Add some new simple SFHs by @TomWagg in https://github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth/pull/120
* Add new orbit plotting functionality by @TomWagg in https://github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth/pull/121
* Add new case studies + minor fixes by @TomWagg in https://github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth/pull/122

1.1.2
=====

- Bug fix: saving ``sfh`` objects with ``save`` now works correctly (previously failed when they had custom parameters)

1.1.1
=====

- Bug fix: ``concat`` functions now accessible in the main namespace

1.1.0
=====

- New feature: Concatenate multiple populations together with ``pop.concat`` or simply `+` (see #116)
