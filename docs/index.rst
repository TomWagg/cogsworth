PACKAGE NAME
************

Welcome! You've found the documentation for ``PACKAGE NAME``, good for you! This is an epic crossover episode of a package in which we bring the worlds of rapid population synthesis and galactic dynamics together and see what happens.

Using ``PACKAGE_NAME`` you can evolve a population of stars using population synthesis, whilst self-consistently integrating their orbits with a galactic potential of your choosing. In this way you can explore the full evolutionary history (both stellar and orbital) of a population of stars and make predictions for present day kinematics and other distributions. We additionally provide tools for transforming the intrinsic populations into observables and for classifying each the nature of each system.

In this documentation you'll find everything you need to get ``PACKAGE_NAME`` working for you! For the new user, we have :doc:`instructions for the installation <pages/install>` of the package, a quick :doc:`getting started page <pages/getting_started>` and a collection of extensive :doc:`tutorials <pages/tutorials>`. For some simple use cases we have a :doc:`gallery of examples <auto_examples/index>`. Additionally if you're looking for some more detailed examples we have a series of case studies demonstrating potential science use cases. Finally, we include exhaustive API documentations in the :doc:`User Guide <pages/modules>`
