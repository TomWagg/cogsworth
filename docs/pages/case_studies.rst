Case Studies
************

This section contains a collection of case studies that demonstrate some more detailed uses of ``cogsworth``.
These are designed to be more in-depth than the tutorials and show how to use the package in a more complex way.
Note that they also will take longer to run if you want to reproduce the results (on the order of 15 minutes each).
